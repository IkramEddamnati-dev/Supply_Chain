## ðŸš€ Backend Setup

### 1. Clone the project repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IkramEddamnati-dev/Supply_Chain.git
cd Supply_Chain
```

````

### 2. Navigate to the backend directory

```bash
cd backend2
```

### 3. Set up a virtual environment

If you're using Python, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv ven
.\ven\Scripts\Activate  # Windows
source ven/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
```

### 4. Install backend dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies for the backend:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the backend server

Start the backend server using uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Your backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## ðŸ“œ Smart Contract Setup

### 1. Install Truffle globally

Make sure you have Truffle installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

### 2. Compile the smart contract

Navigate to the smart contract folder and compile the contract:

```bash
truffle compile
```

### 3. Migrate the contract

Run the migration to deploy your contract to the blockchain:

```bash
truffle migrate
```

### 4. Interact with the contract

Once migrated, you can interact with your smart contract from the backend or frontend as needed.
